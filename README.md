This project is a full-stack web application consisting of a Laravel API backend and a Vue.js frontend with TypeScript. It features a user management system with role-based access control, allowing users to register, log in, and be assigned specific roles.

Backend (Laravel API):

 • Built with Laravel as the backend framework.
 • Implements user authentication with JWT for secure login.
 • Supports CRUD operations for managing users and roles.
 • MySQL is used as the database, and the project is compatible with XAMPP for local development.

Frontend (Vue.js + TypeScript):

 • Built with Vue.js as the frontend framework.
 • Uses Vue CLI and TypeScript for development.
 • Includes a user registration and login page, connected to the Laravel backend API.
 • Makes API requests to the backend for user management.

Key Features:

 • User role assignment and management.
 • Secure user authentication and authorization.
 • Easy-to-use interface with modern front-end tools and technologies.

Setup Instructions:
 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Set up the Laravel backend by installing dependencies with composer install, configuring .env, and running php artisan migrate.
 3. Set up the Vue.js frontend by installing dependencies with npm install, and adjusting API endpoints if necessary.
 4. Run both the frontend and backend servers locally.
